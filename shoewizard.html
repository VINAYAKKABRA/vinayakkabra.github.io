        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>ShoeWizard is a prototype meant to make online shopping for athletic shoes easier. Our main goal throughout this project was to ensure the user’s needs and requirements were met. Another goal of our project was to support the user in their sense-making task of buying shoes.
          This project was done as a part of our project for course CS 522: Human-Computer Interaction, where we learned about sensemaking, ideation, meta-data, facets, etc. We were asked to design a website for a comparative shopping experience. We decided to limit the experience to shoes, as it is something everybody wears no matter the weather, function, or activity. And since everybody has different experiences, it was easier to gather user experiences and breakdowns for a specific product than for every product in general.</p>

        <h3>MY ROLE</h3>
        <p>Documentation, wireframe design, scenario design, storyboarding, script design, user study, and user feedback were all areas to which I contributed.</p>

        <h3>DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
        <p>The main goal of user interviews was to identify users' experiences while shopping online. We targeted an audience between the ages of 18 and 35. In total, we interviewed<strong> 11 people.</strong> Below is the data collected during the user study.</p>
          <br>

        <div class="grid">
          <a href="ShoeWizard/affinity.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/affinity.jpg" alt=""></a>
        </div>

        <p>After collecting user data, we organized it, and based on user experiences and needs, we created <i>a wireframe</i> in Balsamiq, which can be seen below.</p>
        
        <div class="grid">
          <a href="ShoeWizard/wire1.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/wire1.PNG" width="49%" height="49%" alt=""></a>
          <a href="ShoeWizard/wire2.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/wire2.PNG" width="49%" height="49%" alt=""></a>
          <a href="ShoeWizard/wire3.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/wire3.PNG" width="49%" height="49%" alt=""></a>
          <a href="ShoeWizard/wire4.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/wire4.PNG" width="49%" height="49%" alt=""></a>
          <center><a href="ShoeWizard/wire5.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/wire5.PNG" width="49%" height="49%" alt=""></a></center>
        </div>

        <p>We also created a lightweight prototype in Figma based on user needs and feedback. The lightweight prototype can be seen below.  </p>

        <div class="grid">
          <a href="ShoeWizard/light1.png" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/light1.png" width="49.5%" height="49.5%" alt=""></a>
          <a href="ShoeWizard/light2.png" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/light2.png" width="49.5%" height="49.5%" alt=""></a>
          <a href="ShoeWizard/light3.png" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/light3.png" width="49.5%" height="49.5%" alt=""></a>
          <a href="ShoeWizard/light4.png" target="_blank"><img src="ShoeWizard/light4.png" width="49.5%" height="49.5%" alt=""></a>
        </div>

        <p><br>Feedback was taken from <strong>6 participants</strong> on the prototype. After organizing user feedback, we incorporated it into the functional prototype.</p>
        
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>
          Mark, an athlete, has always bought a certain brand of gym shoes but now wants to try something new. His friend from the gym recommends he use the “ShoeWizard” website to browse for new shoes. Mark really values a good price, the type of shoe, and the brand. He also wants to try the shoe on in person before buying it. When he opens ShoeWizard, he is directed to the home page, where he can select shoes by brand and activity. On the homepage, he can also see what shoes are available near him for his convenience to try on.
          If he wants to search for a specific shoe, he can use the search bar. Using search, he can sort by price and filter by activity and price. When he clicks on a shoe, he will see pictures of the shoe, the height and width, the price, and the websites the shoe is available on (there is a price comparison here too). He can create lists for his specific activity and save his preferences/ favorites. He can create as many lists as he likes. He has narrowed his purchase down to 2 shoes after being able to compare the shoes using our features. He tries them on in person at Dick Sporting Goods and returns to our ShoeWizard after he sees that Finish Line has the pair he wants for cheaper.
          
          <h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
          The working prototype contains a fixed number of items because our main objective was to demonstrate our knowledge of the UX design process. Consequently, for future development, a broader selection of brands and items from a wider range of websites could be added to improve the comparative shopping experience.
          
          <h3>LEARNINGS</h3>
          The user study provided us with a more in-depth understanding of user experiences and breakdowns. It assisted us in determining which aspects and meta-data were more important to users and their experiences with current sites. It demonstrated the significance of user research in understanding users’ needs and developing a functional website. Building prototypes enabled us to demonstrate our idea to people and obtain critical feedback for iterating the improvements into a functioning prototype.
          Each phase in the design process was critical since the final result would have looked significantly different without it.</p>
